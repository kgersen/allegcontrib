planning for beta 1:

AGM: (game manager)
- cleanup
AME: (map editor)
x finish map validity
x custom render rocks (bases,ships,missiles and counter so far)
- change server core.
* bug fix: Z coords now shown when been set (ctrl+LBM on object)
- more control on loading map
* Paste  = shift + LMB click
* Copy   = shift + RMB click
* Delete = ctrl  + RMB click
* added: DM option
* added: "N/A" imbalance choice
* added: allow eject pods toggle, Friendly fire and Lives
- multi select
* A lay-down rocks option with the following parameters:
   Center (CX,CY,CZ), Radius ,Z Variance (ZVar) ,  Number of rocks (nbrocks)
   Generate nbrocks (using rock templates for size,hp and sig) on a given disc
   (Center and radius).
   The rocks are randomly placed within the disc boundaries. 
   If ZVar is 0, all rocks are on the same Z plan (CZ), otherwise
   they're randomly set above and under the Z plan (CZ) (ie between CZ+ZVaz and CZ-Zvar).

\*****************************************************************************/


This is a modification of the user interface of Allegiance
(http://www.freeallegiance.org/). It is based on and inspired by Ksero's
modification (forum thread lost).


Changes in CortUI (compared to default UI):
-------------------------------------------
All HUDs:
- CortUI comes with an installer that allows you to install or uninstall CortUI
  and allows you to customize certain settings.
- Ten lines of chat are shown in the lobby. [optionally, configurable]
- Chat has up to ten lines instead of five. [configurable]
- It also has a scrollbar. [optionally]
- Chat at the loadout screen has an independent number of chat lines from the
  at other screens. [configurable]
- Map-mode shows all necessary ship status info in upper left area of the
  screen. (Autopilot and vector-lock status, name of current target, KB of the
  current target, distance to current target, speed of the current target,
  your ship type (and whether you are in the turret of this ship), shield
  status, hull status, energy status, ammo status, fuel status, O2 level,
  current thrust, current speed, current signature, kill bonus.)
- When in base, map-mode shows your ship type and your KB.
- All screens display your pilot when in the turret of another ship.
- No more overlapping text lines.
- Smaller and moved mission briefing screen to be able to read the chat and see
  the team sizes during countdown. [optionally]
- Inventory and minimap have been moved to the side for map-mode, thereby
  making more room for the actual map.
- F3 command-pane has been shrunk so that it won't overlap the inventory
  screen. (This is now probably obsolete, but I haven't removed it yet anyway.)
- Ripcord time is now displayed in map-mode as well, not only in flight-mode.
- Some HUD-controls are shown during launch animation (chat, minimap,
  inventory, etc.).
- The positioning of the windows in hangar and map when in base have been
  moved, so that ten lines of chat can be displayed at all times.
- Base status display in hangar-mode has been modified, to not overlap with the
  chat. It is also shown at the map when in base now.
- The 'last orders list' is displayed in the cockpit, in the hangar and on the
  map when in base. [optionally]
- Parts of the hangar graphics have been removed to not overlap with the
  chat. [optionally]
- The drawing order of the windows has been rearranged (e.g. critical info over
  investments, investments over inventory).
- Help button in hangar-mode has been removed (use the ESC menu instead).
- The back-button at the map has been removed (use F3 instead).
- The back-button in the hangar has been removed (use ESC-q instead).
- The 'default loadout' button at the loadout screen has been moved to the
  lower right to lower the chance of clicking it by accident.
- Some fixed typos in the 'tips of the game'.
- The version number of the modification is shown in the lower right corner of
  the map.
- The 'dialogs='-part of dialog.mdl has been extensively commented and
  refactored. (no effect on gameplay)

Classic CortUI:
- Autopilot and vector-lock status in flight-mode have been moved and the
  graphics have been made smaller to not overlap with the chat.
  
Software HUD with displayed targeting view:
- Just the default software HUD with the addition of the targeting view, nothing
  else.
  
'Raveen-style':
- A completely revamped software HUD.

'Parci-style':
- An even more radical modification.

lessHUD (by FlingPu):
- A remodeled HUD that is slimmer and less obscuring

JelloShot (by FlingPu):
- A complete replacement HUD for higher resolutions featuring a centralized
  target view.


Installation:
-------------
1. Shut down Allegiance.
2. Run the installer.
3. Launch Allegiance.


Uninstallation:
-------------
1. Shut down Allegiance.
2. Run the uninstaller (Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs -> Free
   Allegiance CortUI).
3. Launch Allegiance.


Additional remarks:
-------------------
- Designed for the being installed over a default, non-modded UI. Slipstream
  GUI is no longer supported, sorry.
- Designed for 800x600 and 1024x768. 640x480 is *not* supported! Higher
  resolutions haven't been tested but are reported to work fine. The modified
  software HUDs ('Raveen-style' and 'Parci-style') require 1024x768 or above!
- lessHUD was designed for 800x600 or higher.
- JelloShot was designed for 1280x1024.  The minimum resolution is 1024x768.
  Lower resolutions will result in the HUD being covered by chat, inventory,
  and map panes.
- To change the settings you made during installation, you have two options:
  Either edit cortui_settings.mdl yourself or just run the installation again.
  This will not harm the uninstallation process at all.
- If you don't like the position of the 'default loadout' button on the loadout
  screen: open loadoutpane.mdl, search for a line that defines
  'defaultBtnPosition' and change the second value from 318 back to 158


Known problems:
---------------
- The transparency of some of the HUD elements of JelloShot has been lost.
  This is due to the switch to PNGs and the responsible import command of the
  Allegiance client not yet supporting PNGs.
- The chat in the loadout screen can't be scrolled with PageUp/PageDown.
  Pressing these buttons anyway will only scroll the chat display of the
  other screens.
- Don't press F4 at the map, the inventory is shown anyway at all times.
- After pressing F3, the 'last hovered over' information of the minimap is
  lost.
- After you died, in the one or two seconds until you return to the station,
  you still see some UI elements that shouldn't be there. :(
- Sometimes, you see the autopilot indicator without having a target. This
  is mainly an Allegiance bug, not a CortUI bug.
- The minimap can no longer be hidden (it can't be toggled at all). (Don't
  press F7. If you accidently do, press it again.)
- The uninstaller doesn't delete the /artwork/mods/CortUI directory, even if
  it's empty. I consider this an NSIS bug until I hear otherwise, because
  RMDir *is* called on the directory and should succeed when it's empty.

  + added display of the player's pilot when in a turreted ship at various
    screens
  + the new (R4) mission briefing screen is now smaller, and has been moved
    so all ten lines of chat can be read and the team (H)ELO sums can be seen
    during game launch
  + various modifications to the loadout screen: the player is now told when
    in a turret, equipment description can now have three lines without running
    out of the box, removed info text that overlapped with other controls

    support

    process into the subdirectory mods/CortUI/media/ (double-yay!)

    modification using the installer (the installer will overwrite the
    respective files with the default MDLs if the modifications are not
    selected)

    not dropping down on some systems
  * cleaned up installer

    investments, investments over inventory)
  * the positioning of the windows in hangar and map when in base have been
    moved, so that ten lines of chat are displayed at all times

To Do:
------
- Fix JelloShot transparency issue by using ImportImageFromFile3D().
  [Requires code change.]
- Redesign dialog.mdl. It has grown way too much and is a real mess, stuff
  being spread out because it has to be initialised in a particular order.
  Split it up into multiple files.
- Investigate whether R4's "minimap shown by default" should be taken into
  account by CortUI / can somehow be used.
- Investigate minimap refreshing issue.
- Investigate installer bug mentioned in the 'Known problems' section.
- Implement detection of all selected HUDs at startup and allow the user to
  choose between all of them. Get rid of the difference between "normal HUDs"
  and "software HUDs". [Requires code change.]

modifications that are based on this one. :)


Acknowledgements:
-----------------
This modification would not have been possible without Ksero's modification,
his excellent documentation of the .mdl-files, and his support!
Thanks to jgbaxter for his help on fixing an installer bug under Win98.
Many thanks to apathos for his numerous bug reports that helped to finally
track down the chat alignment bug.
Thanks to Ksero and Tigereye for reporting a triggered assertion that led to
fixing the command bar column bug.
Thanks to a neverending list of people helping with testing, or sometimes
just holding a server open so I can run experiments more rapidly.

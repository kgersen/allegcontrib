Change Log
===========
v1.51
-Fixed crash bug when firing turrets on a ship without primary weapons (Thanks Psylence)
-Fixed the accuracy slider. When the heck did this stop working? (Thanks Psylence)
-Fixed calculation bug where ships wouldn't "reload ammo", yielding incorrect TTKs
-Clicking in most places of the Comparison form now closes any open AngleChoosers. (Thanks Ksero)
-Aleph Resonators now work as in game: They don't inflict any damage, or contribute to 'Time To Kill" calculations. (Thanks Psylence, GreyVulpine)
-Added grey bars to help visually separate the 3 areas on the Comparison form
-DM/AC form now shows which DM or AC it's listing. (Thanks Noir)
-Fixed calculation bug when using a ship that had 0 energy by default (non-belters interceptors). (Thanks GreyVulpine)

v1.50 Release!
-Added "°" character to Bearing to make it that much more intuitive
-Fixed bug where Missile Ranges only showed up when comparing 2 targets. The range now shows up regardless of the existance of a target

v1.48 Release Candidate 5
-Fixed crash bug that occured because closing the MyComparison form didn't properly clean up its resources. Thanks GreyVulpine
-Fixed crash bug while using the FireTurret checkboxes on the Ship Info form. Mental note: Stop cut'n'pasting code and assuming it works! Thanks GreyVulpine
-Changed the Ship Info screen's "Board" ability to "Captures" since it appears ICE has it mislabelled. (Thanks whoever told me this :s Sorry I forget who it was)
-Added an upper limit of 1 hour to kill simulations. If it ever gets that high, the loop will abort and return time "NaN".

v1.47 Release Candidate 4
-Fixed bug where changing faction crashed only *sometimes*... it had to do with wiping "me" and "target". Thanks Psylence.
-Fixed bug where changing "Me" didn't update the comparison window. I broke this by fixing something else.
	Stupid typos. I need to stop coding at 2-3am... (Thanks Psylence)
-Fixed bug where clicking the "x" to close the MyComprison window didn't fully close it, causing a future crash
	when trying to change "Me" or "Target". Thanks GreyVulpine
-Added "Show Overridden Items" option to control whether or not TEK will show "Gatt 1" if "Gatt 2" is researched, etc.
-Total Cost no longer includes the starting Garrison in its calculation (Thanks KSero)
-Fixed bug where you couldn't drag Me or Target onto a blank ComparisonForm. Now you can!
	This allows you to do what I originally intended... you update "me" on any form, and
	any other comparison that was done with "me" updates automatically
-Fixed crash bug that occured because closing the MyComparison form didn't properly clean up its resources. Thanks GreyVulpine

v1.46 Release Candidate 3
-Added "Launch Speed" box next to Missiles on the Comparison form. It sets the speed of your ship when firing the missile (to calculate Range)
-Fixed bug where changing objects sometimes made Comparisons close when trying to update
-Fixed crash bug when attempting to view the info of a probe that doesn't shoot like EWS Probes. (Thanks JimmyNighthawk)

-Fixed miscalculation with nanites. Now they repair hull as ingame (Thanks GreyVulpine)

-Aleph Resonators don't calculate damage on ships anymore (Thanks GreyVulpine)
-Fixed crash bug when setting me or target with the My Comparison window open (Thanks Spunkmeyer, GreyVulpine)

-I *THINK* I fixed a bug where it wouldn't select your manually-chosen CoreLocation in the same session as setting your DefaultCoreLocation in the options dialog.
	You'd only run into this problem if you didn't have an Allegiance\Artwork registry key. (Thanks Spunkmeyer)
-Removed overridden ships/stations/probes from the Objects list to reduce clutter. If you have Enh Fighter, Fighter will no longer be listed.
